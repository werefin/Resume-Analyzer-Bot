## AI recruitment analysis

This Streamlit app uses **OpenAI GPT-4o** and **LangChain** to analyze candidate resumes against job descriptions.  
It extracts structured information, generates summaries, and provides a **match score (0â€“100)** for recruitment suitability.

### Features
- Upload or auto-load resumes & job descriptions (`.txt` or `.pdf`).
- Extract key candidate information (education, skills, work history, etc.).
- Generate AI-powered summary of candidate suitability.
- Compute a **matching score** with scoring criteria.
- Download results as `.txt`.

The `test` folder contains example files to quickly test the bot:
- `cv.txt`: example candidate resume.
- `job_description.txt`: example job description.
